# AN588_Modules
This repository contains all the Modules for Boston University's AN588: Project Design and Statistics in Biological Anthropology course.
Each R-markdown file contains the full module walkthrough, the challenges associated with each respective module, as well as explanations for each component of the module.
The explanations/comments are made by combining AN588's Professor Christopher Schmitt (fuzzyatelin) and my, Allister Malik (A-Malik03), own explanations of how Rstudio functions.

The goal of this repository is to help me (and others) use Rstudio's many functions and packages available in the Fall Semester (5 September - 15 December 2023) so I can look back and use it for my own papers/work or relearn in the future.
